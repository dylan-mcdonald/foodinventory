				<h2>User Persona - Deanna, Small Business Owner</h2>
				<p>
					Deanna is the owner of a small business that employees five jewelry makers.
					Her vision was an online store that would market the original handmade pieces to the world
					so that the local New Mexican flare could be seen everywhere. Her company made some great
					contacts early on and was able to sell pieces to some large stores in New York and other fashion
					destination around the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem has never been sales for Deanna, the problem has been keeping up with those sales
					and all the logistical issues they create. Deanna can use an inventory management system to keep up
					with not only sales and products in her inventory but the raw materials such as beads and clasps used
					everyday.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a small business owner, mother, and wife, Deanna needs an inventory application that not only gives her
					clear and concise data but does so intuitively. A text message on her phone alerting her to low levels of
					product is a perfect solution since she's often on the go and can't otherwise check in with her physical
					inventory any other way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Deanna as many other small business owners do, tried excel spreadsheets and QuickBooks and its
					inventory application plugin. At first these seemed viable and helpful but there was no way of staying ahead
					of the inventory game unless she constantly opened cumbersome software and read between the lines of
					accounting in order to decipher how many green beads were out of inventory and at what point was it crucial
					she order more.
				</p>

				<h2>Use Cases</h2>
				<p>
					With "Inventory text", Deanna is able to receive alerts based on inventory items and levels she sets. These
					alerts allow her plenty of lead time in ordering raw material and scheduling product completion so the
					proverbial shelves never go empty. The applications ability to not only take out a sold item from inventory but
					also the raw product from backroom stock is essentially having an extra dedicated employee that
					she would not otherwise be able to afford.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the administrator for Inventory text, Deanna will assign an employee to act as a warehouse agent and that
					employee will add products and raw materials into inventory as needed and log sold inventory that sales in their
					retail location as well insure the web sales and shopping cart plugin are up to date and accurate. Deanna
					will add new unique items to the database as they are made and then they can be accessed
					by the warehouse agent account with its unique set of permissions. Every item that was removed from inventory
					by the employee would be logged so that Deanna could review and keep up with all outgoing products. She could
					also see what was popular and trending from the current product selections and adjust her decisions accordingly.
