				<h2>User Persona - Nick, Manager at Napoli's Coffee House</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Profession: </strong>Nick Brady is a manager at Napoli's Coffee House. Napoli's is famous for their
					exquisite roasted coffee blends and fruity flavors. Their fruity flavors come from syrups such as Torani and Monin.
					They sell around three hundred cups of coffee a day.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>Nick is constantly serving customers during store hours. This
					leaves Nick very little time to order new supplies. Traditionally when the store is closed on Sundays,
					this is when Nick will check inventory and order new supplies.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>Even though Nick does his best to predict his flavor needs for the
					week, on any day he can run out of one of the most popular flavors. In order to keep his business going he
					must obtain new bottles of that flavor as soon as possible. His concerns about this are that he needs to find
					a local company that carries his brand of syrup as well as has his specific flavor. Lately, he finds that Cost
					Plus World Market often carries the Torani Brand of Syrups.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Goals: </strong>Unfortunately Cost Plus doesn't always have the specific flavor that Nick is needs.
					Nick is looking for a way that he can query Cost Plus' shelf inventory to find out if they have in stock the
					flavor he wants. This would save him from going on a wild goose chase.
				</p>

				<h2>Use Cases</h2>
				<p>
					1 <strong>Nick checks inventory: </strong>Once Nick has accessed a computer he types in Cost Plus' web address.
					After landing on the home page, he promptly logs in using his personal email and password. This sends him straight
					to the main inventory search page. He types in the product he's looking for into the page's search bar. Results are
					then displayed for products along the lines of the search terms. He is suddenly faced with disappointment because in
					fact Cost Plus has just run out of that very syrup.
				</p>
				<p>
					2 <strong>Nick texts keyword search term: </strong>Nick pulls out his phone and opens his messaging app. His
					number has already been registered with Cost Plus' inventory text messaging service, so he then pulls up the
					inventory number he was given. He types out the inventory search term that was listed on the website for the
					type of syrup he has just run out of. Nick pushes send. Moments later a response message comes to his phone
					indicating that there is one bottle on the shelf of his exact syrup left. He is so overwhelmed that he skips
					all the way to his car.
				</p>
