		<p> Deanna is the owner of a small business that employees five jewelry makers.
		Her vision was an online store that would market the original handmade pieces to the world
		so that the local New Mexican flare could be seen everywhere. Her company made some great
		contacts early on and was able to sell pieces to some large stores in New York and other fashion
		destinations. <br/>

		The problem has never been sales for Deanna, the problem has been keeping up with those sales
		and all the logistical issues they create. Deanna can use an inventory management system to keep up
		with not only sales and products in her inventory but the raw materials such as beads and clasps used
		everyday.<br/>

		As a small business owner, mother, and wife, Deanna needs an inventory application that not only gives her
		clear and concise data but does so intuitively. A text message on her phone alerting her to low levels of
		product is a perfect solution since she's often on the go and can't otherwise check in with her physical
		inventory any other way.<br/>

		Deanna as many other small business owners do, tried excel spreadsheets and QuickBooks and its
		inventory application plugin. At first these seemed viable and helpful but there was no way of staying ahead
		of the inventory game unless she constantly opened cumbersome software and read between the lines of
		accounting in order to decipher how many green beads were out of inventory and at what point was it crucial
		she order more.<br/>

		With "Inventory text", Deanna is able to receive alerts based on inventory items and levels she sets. These
		alerts allow her plenty of lead time in ordering raw material and scheduling product completion so the
		proverbial shelves never go empty. The applications ability to not only take out a sold item from inventory but
		also the raw product from backroom stock is essentially having an extra dedicated employee that
		she would not otherwise be able to afford.  </br>

		As the administrator for Inventory text, Deanna will assign an employee to act as a warehouse agent and that
		employee will add products and raw materials into inventory as needed and log sold inventory that sales in their
		retail location as well insure the web sales and shopping cart plugin are up to date and accurate. Deanna
		will be responsible for adding new unique items to the database as they are made and then they can be accessed
		by the warehouse agent account with its unique set of permissions. Every item that was removed from inventory
		by the employee would be logged so that Deanna could review and keep up with all outgoing products. She could
		also see what was popular and trending from the current product selections and adjust her decisions accordingly.
