				<h2> System Goals</h2>
				<p> The main focus of "Inventory Text" is to fill a gap for small business owners that could use an
					inventory system that acts as an extra employee. By responding intuitively via text and a web application,
					the software will give the business owner accurate and prompt information so that they can
					reorder items before running out, decide what has been most popular among the inventory and see
					what items need to be promoted or price adjusted due to low sales. The software will also keep track of raw
					materials and send alerts based on user preference so that no time or money is lost due to lack of resources </p>
